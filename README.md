I bring a unique blend of back-end expertise (C#, ASP.NET MVC, Web API, Entity Framework) and front-end skills (Angular, Blazor, JavaScript), along with practical knowledge in Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM.

I'm committed to writing clean, testable code using SOLID principles and Clean Architecture. I'm continuously learning, contributing to open-source projects, and staying updated with the latest industry trends.
